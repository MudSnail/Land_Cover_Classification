# Land_Cover_Classification
This project was done for a Aggregate Intellect workshop on Earth & Environmental Data Science and in collaboration with [Fynn Davis](https://github.com/fynnweaver).

## About the Project
This project focuses on using machine learning to classify NRCAN 2015 Canada land cover using Sentinel-2 data.

This repo contains all the base testing including:

- Pipeline comparisons
    - Different models
    - Different extents
    - Optimization
    - Feature Importance
- Calculated Layers
- Normalization Techniques

[Fynn Davis's](https://github.com/fynnweaver/Land_Cover_Classification) repo contains:

- Prediction Maps
- Feature Selection from the image
    - Filtering
    - K-means clustering
    - Edge Detection
    - Geocoordinates
- Overlapping Model Predictions
