# Land_Cover_Classification
This project was done for a Aggregate Intellect workshop on Earth & Environmental Data Science and in partnership with [Fynn Davis](https://github.com/fynnweaver).

## About the Project
This project focuses on using machine learning to classify land cover in Canada using Sentinel-2 data.

In Canada, NRCAN data from 2015 was used to identify land cover classes 0 to 19.
